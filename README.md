== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the cookie consent message? =
Navigate to **Settings > Cookie Consent** in your WordPress dashboard. You will find a text area labeled "Cookie Consent Text" where you can customize the message. Basic HTML tags like `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<a>` are supported.

= Can I link to my custom Privacy Policy page? =
Yes! In the plugin settings (**Settings > Cookie Consent**), there's a field for "Privacy Policy Link." You can enter the URL of your custom privacy policy page there. By default, it will link to your WordPress-generated privacy policy page.

= How do I change the position of the banner? =
On the settings page, use the "Banner Position" dropdown to select from options like "Bottom Left," "Bottom Right," "Top Center," "Full Width (Bottom)," and more.

= Is this plugin GDPR/CCPA compliant? =
Yes, the plugin is designed to help you meet the requirements of GDPR, CCPA, and other global privacy regulations by providing a clear consent mechanism. However, full legal compliance also depends on your specific website content and how you handle user data beyond the banner. Consult legal advice if you are unsure.

= What if I want to reset the settings to default? =
Currently, there isn't a "reset to default" button in the plugin. If you wish to revert all settings, you would need to deactivate and then reactivate the plugin. This will re-apply the initial default settings.
